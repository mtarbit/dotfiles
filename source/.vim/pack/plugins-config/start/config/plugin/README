This directory path only exists so I can add config that needs to run after
any native plugins are loaded (or at least after they have been added to the
runtimepath). There's probably a nicer way to handle this but I wasn't able
to find it after several attempts.

The issue is that vim-context-commentstring is configured via an autoloaded
dictionary, but we can't add a key to that dictionary in our .vimrc because
the autoloading wont work until the plugin path is included in runtimepath.
Plugin paths are only added to the runtimepath *after* .vimrc is evaluated.

As a work-around I've added this 'plugins-config' path since it'll be added
to the runtimepath at the same time as 'plugins'. It doesn't matter if the
"fake" config plugin runs before the "real" plugin since we only need the
autoloading to work to set the config and any setup can happen afterwards.

See `:h packload-two-steps` for details.
